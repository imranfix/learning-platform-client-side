A Web Developer career path tends to follow two distinct routes, depending on whether you’re looking for the security of a salaried position or you prefer to have the autonomy that comes with being a freelancer. <br /> <br />

In a full-time web development position, you’d collaborate with other developers and programmers as part of a larger development team, whether you’re working for an agency or a company. This route offers opportunities for getting into managing projects or teams and liaising with a client or stakeholders from other backgrounds outside of tech. <br /> <br />

With programming skills in high demand, full-time jobs in web development are not scarce. A few years into a career in web development, you might qualify for a six-figure salary as a Senior Web Developer along with other employer perks and bonuses. <br /> <br />

There are also many benefits to freelancing. Freelance Web Developers create their own schedules and are free to select projects that truly interest them. Self-employed Web Developers essentially run their own business, so it’s important to build strong relationships with their clients that could translate to a full-time job down the line. Since they set their own price, a freelance professional with serious programming talent could theoretically reach a higher pay grade much faster than an entry-level development would take to become a senior employee. <br /> <br />

Freelance is also likely the way to go for any web development professional who wants to work remotely.
